```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM status2datetime) AS year,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM status2datetime) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
WHERE status2datetime BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'
  AND order_status_id = 9
GROUP BY year, month

```

Answer:

Monthly Orders (2024)
Year	Month	Total Orders
2024	1	39,307
2024	2	40,177
2024	3	40,593
2024	4	35,847
2024	5	38,656
2024	6	31,508
2024	7	29,492
2024	8	32,523
2024	9	35,995
2024	10	40,606
2024	11	47,755
2024	12	40,364
Monthly Orders (2025)
Year	Month	Total Orders
2025	1	39,365
2025	2	35,419

## Q5: Order Frequency by Month (2024 & 2025 Separately)

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM status2datetime) AS year,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM status2datetime) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
  COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) AS unique_clients,
  ROUND(COUNT(*)::numeric / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT client_id), 0), 2) AS order_frequency
FROM orders
WHERE status2datetime BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'
  AND order_status_id = 9
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
```

Steps:
COUNT(*) = total orders
COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) = number of unique clients
order_frequency = average number of orders per client in that month
NULLIF(..., 0) protects against division by zero
Answer:

Year	Total Orders	Unique Clients	Order Frequency
2024	452,823	60,251	7.52
2025	202,840	26,100	7.77
